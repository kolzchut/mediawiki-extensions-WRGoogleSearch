Adds Special:GoogleSearch which allows to use a Google CSE
(Google Custom Search Engine). It can also replace the regular
wiki search for all or select groups.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

- $wgWRGoogleSearchCSEID = 'Your CSE ID here'.
  The search engine ID you get from Google.

- $wgWRGoogleSearchOnly = true/false. Whether to take over the regular search.

- $wgWRGoogleSearchExemptGroups = array( 'user' ). If $wgWRGoogleSearchOnly is true,
  this will be an array of user groups that still get the regular search.
