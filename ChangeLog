Changelog
==========

1.0.1
-----
Do not take over inputboxes with class 'internalSearch'. This allows
extension:SearchBoxes to maintain its search destinations.

1.0.0
-----
A much improved version of Google Search:

- No additional search form in the special page;
  the sidebar search is now used for it.
- No loading of Google JS in regular pages;
  we now just send the query to the special page
- Page icon is Google CSE instead of a generic one,
  in order to give proper credit.

0.1.3
-----
The original version, based on Extension:GoogleSiteSearch (v2.0) by Ryan Finnie.
